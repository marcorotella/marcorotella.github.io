We've all been there at least once, if you are like me, many times! A lot of cool ideas, the brain crunching a lot of different layouts, configurations, application and networking deployments and in the end you are stuck staring at the screen on the ebay / aliexpress / shady websites listings to find the best fit for your needs and the best bangs for your bucks.

And i am exactly there. 

Therefore i thought, why not going through a design process, why not to write about this in the first place in a structured way, a little bit like this:

1. Set the target
2. Deisgn the architecture and the general layout
3. Bill of materials
4. Purchasing:
