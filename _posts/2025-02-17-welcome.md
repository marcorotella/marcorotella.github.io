It's been a long time since I first thought about opening a blog, and here we are.

This blog will be all about IT, Tech, and Automation. It serves as a personal online note, how-to guide, and project repository for me, and a resource for you, hoping to help the community find ideas, instructions, and maybe inspiration from my experience.

The topics I will cover may vary, as I am interested in different matters. To give you a little bit of context, these are the topics I hope to cover in the foreseeable future:

- Virtualization (Proxmox, Proxmox Backup Server)
- Storage (Ceph, ZFS, LVM, NAS, etc.)
- Networking (Fortigate, Unifi, Cisco, Mikrotik, generic networking topics)
- Automation (Twincat, ADS, IPCs, System Integration, Open Source Automation platforms, Ethercat, MQTT, etc.)
- Linux in general
- Containerization (Docker, Rancher, Portainer, k3s, etc.)
- Hardware (Servers, Networking Gear)
- Home Lab (all around)

That's all for the time being. See you soon!
